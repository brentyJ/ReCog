## What Changed and Why

### Attribution Analysis

| Change | Cause | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| More specific dates | DOB injection | "age 19" instead of "young" |
| Career insights | Life context | Police work themes now identified |
| Relationship timeline | Life context | Sarah J breakup correctly dated to 2019 |
| Higher joy/hope | Age framing | LLM sees growth arc over time |
| Pet references | Life context | Artie/Jessie connection identified |

### Pattern Synthesis Reduction

The dramatic drop in patterns (67 → 13) is due to:
1. Synth engine only found 5 viable clusters with new insights
2. Different clustering behavior with run-specific insights
3. May need to run synthesis separately with different parameters

## Next Steps

1. Add more life context events (career end dates, locations)
2. Run Facebook data extraction for event date refinement
3. Consider re-running synthesis with adjusted clustering
4. Track deltas between subsequent runs
